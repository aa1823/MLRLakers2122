# Multiple Linear Regression of the 2021-2022 Lakers Regular Season


As the value of sports teams increases and technical analytics advances, many find that basketball analytics is a burgeoning field of research for application of these avenues. From sports betting to predicting player performance using aggregate data provided by many basketball sources such as NBA.com or Basketball-reference.com, many statisticians and analysts are clamoring to use modeling to their advantage.

**The goal of this MLR analysis of the 2021-2022 Lakers season is to assess whether or not effective field goal percentage, free throw percentage, games played, personal fouls, steals, and blocks are good indicators of points per game performance during the season.** 

This file contains full per-game stats for each player on the Lakers from 2018 through 2022. 
Data was adapted from https://www.basketball-reference.com/ and https://www.nba.com/lakers/stats
